Patch Notes
v1.1: Changed default font size back to the previous .9em, Put the home button back where it belongs so people can waste 3 seconds of their life every time they misclick it, moved the connection socket under the navbar-left, fixed a bug with the logout button, moved the news article down so it doesn't cover the ad, added code to the editor pages.
